# The World of Solwyn

---

# Player Introduction: Welcome to Solwyn

> Welcome to **Solwyn** — a world shaped by ancient magic, blazing light, and shadows that have never fully faded.
>
> Long ago, a living sun graced the skies, its shards now scattered across the land, pulsing with wild, forgotten power.
> Across Solwyn’s great spine, the **Cloudspire Peaks** stab into storm-wracked skies, their monasteries clinging to cliffs and whispering secrets to the lightning.
> To the south, the **Verdant Expanse** pulses with untamed magic, where trees walk, rivers shift their course, and spirits weave the dreams of those who dare enter.
> In the north, the **Ember Wastes** hide the tombs of once-mighty Ashen Kings, where winds scrape bone and sand from half-buried cities.
> On the glittering **Sapphire Coast**, fortunes rise and fall with the tides, as masked merchant princes and pirate captains barter gold for blood.
> Far to the east, the **Moonlit Isles** drift beneath veils of mist, where rain flows upward and lost civilizations sing through the fog.
>
> **Here, the world itself is alive.** Storms are not merely storms—they are thinking tempests. Jungles do not just grow—they awaken. The sea does not just churn—it remembers.
> In Solwyn, the brave chase after relics of the First Sun, forge uneasy alliances with spirit-bound powers, and carve their legends into a land that remembers every triumph and every betrayal.
>
> Whether you are a relic hunter from the shifting dunes, a storm-touched monk from the peaks, a freebooter of the misty isles, or something wholly unexpected, know this:
>
> **Solwyn rewards the daring. It devours the foolish. And it never, ever forgets.**

# Major Regions

## Ember Wastes
A sun-scorched expanse of endless dunes, ancient tombs, and crumbling ruins. Winds whisper through abandoned cities, carrying secrets of the Ashen Kings.

## Cloudspire Peaks
Jagged mountains that slice through the sky, often wrapped in stormclouds. Monasteries cling to cliffs, and ancient magics crackle with the Breathless Tempests.

## Sapphire Coast
A glittering, tropical shoreline bursting with trade cities, pirate coves, and merchant intrigue. Fortunes are made and lost with the tides.

## Verdant Expanse
An ancient, sprawling jungle teeming with wild magic, sentient flora, and spirits. The deeper one goes, the less the rules of reality seem to apply.

## Moonlit Isles
A scattered chain of mystical islands shrouded in mist, ancient ruins, and supernatural phenomena. A haven for pirates, mystics, and madmen. Among the most famous are the **Weeping Isles**, a subcluster where rain flows upward and the ruins of a sunken civilization glow beneath the waters.
