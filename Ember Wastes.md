# **Ember Wastes**

A sun-scorched expanse of endless dunes, ancient tombs, and crumbling ruins. Winds whisper through abandoned cities, carrying secrets of the Ashen Kings.

## **Major Cities**

### **Vaer Rhadin**
- **Atmosphere:** Hot, dusty, filled with relic hunters and tomb raiders.
- **Leadership:** The Ruby Council (merchant-kings and sorcerers)
- **Factions:** Gilded Scarabs, Ashen Guard, Silent Choir
- **Adventure Hooks:** Cursed tomb leaking spirits; black market relic smuggling; council political intrigue.

**Physical Layout:**
Vaer Rhadin sprawls around a massive stone mesa at the desert’s edge. The city spirals outward in dusty concentric rings — noble houses and temples crown the mesa, merchant quarters below, and ramshackle outskirts at the base where caravans gather. Hidden tunnels and sunken bazaars connect the layers underground.

**Architecture:**
Buildings are made of pale sandstone and sun-hardened brick. Flat roofs and shaded courtyards dominate. Tall minaret towers catch the sun, and great canvas awnings crisscross the marketplaces. Reflected light glints off thousands of bronze and mirrored surfaces, making the city shimmer.

**Atmosphere Vibe:**
The scent of spice and scorched sand. Hawk cries overhead. A hum of chanting from solar shrines. Wind stirring grit down narrow alleys. Always hot, but vibrant with energy.

**People:**
A mix of humans, tieflings, dwarves, and genasi. Many wear flowing robes, mirrored jewelry, and sun-marked tattoos. Proud, sharp-eyed, quick to bargain or challenge.

**Economy:**
Fueled by relic trading, desert spice caravans, and artifact smuggling. Sun-blessed metals and glassworks are prized exports. The black market is nearly as powerful as the official trade houses.

**Leisure and Fun:**
- Sun-duels in the grand arena at high noon.
- Dune-racing with spirit-touched sandrunners.
- Betting on gladiator fights between summoned desert beasts.

**Work:**
- Relic hunters and desert guides.
- Artisans crafting mirrored jewelry and sun-blessed weapons.
- Caravan guards and spice traders.

**Points of Interest:**
- **The Gilded Bazaar:** A labyrinth of markets where everything from sacred texts to cursed relics can be bought... for a price.
- **The Temple of the Shard:** An enormous, mirror-faced temple said to house a true fragment of the First Sun.
- **The Whispering Dunes:** Shifting sands on the outskirts where voices are said to call travelers to their deaths.

**Local Threats or Tensions:**
- Rival Sunseeker orders escalating into open violence.
- Silent Choir cultists stirring unrest with dark omens.
- Merchant houses plotting a quiet civil war over control of the Gilded Bazaar.

**Rumors:**
- A newly uncovered tomb beneath the city holds a weapon blessed by the First Sun — and cursed by the Ashen Kings.
- A rogue caravan returned from the Wastes carrying \"living sand\" that whispers at night.
- The Ruby Council’s High Scribe is secretly dying... and the Council’s unity may shatter when he falls.

**Cultural Flavor:**
- Every home hangs a polished mirror facing east to catch the blessing of the dawn.
- Newborns are ritually anointed with sun-water — holy water left to warm under the noonday sun.
- It is considered a grave insult to cast your shadow across someone's market stall without permission.

## **Landmarks**

### **Sunken Palace**
- Half-buried tomb of the Last Ashen King, swallowed by the sands after the fall of the Ashen Empire. Linked to the Shattering of the First Sun, though its mystery remains distinct from the drowned cities of the Moonlit Isles.

## **Minor Settlements**

- **Sandrest:** Neutral fortified caravanserai.
- **Glassmere:** Town built around natural glass formations.
- **Mirage's End:** Ghost village swallowed by dunes.

## **Cultural Profile**

**General Attitude:**
Life in the Ember Wastes demands cunning *and* reverence.
Survivors are expected to be quick-witted and opportunistic, seizing advantages when they can — but also to show deep respect for the ancient powers buried beneath the sands. Words are chosen carefully, and silent gestures or symbols often carry more weight than loud declarations.

**Style and Dress:**
People wear flowing robes and turbans, designed to shield them from the brutal desert sun and sandstorms. Embroidered patterns show house allegiance, clan ancestry, or personal achievements. Practicality blends with a surprising vibrancy of color among wealthier classes.

**Architecture:**
Fortified sandstone cities rise from the dunes, with thick walls to keep out raiders and sandstorms. Much of life happens underground, in cool, labyrinthine chambers and marketplaces hidden beneath the surface. Water cisterns and shaded wells are treasured community centers.

**Festivals and Customs:**
The Trial of Suns is the greatest event in the desert — a grueling endurance race across the unforgiving dunes, held once a generation. Competitors are tested by the desert itself; some vanish into myth, others return legends. Winning the Trial brings a name sung for centuries.

**Relationship to Magic:**
Magic is respected but ritualized. Only sanctioned magic — such as water-calling, sand-warding, or spirit-blessing — is seen as acceptable. Anything resembling necromancy, uncontrolled elemental forces, or relic-magic from the Ashen Kings is deeply feared and could result in exile… or worse.

## **Flashpoints**

### **The Awakening Choir**
- **What’s Happening:** The Silent Choir completes a ritual to awaken an Ashen King beneath Vaer Rhadin.
- **Factions Involved:** Silent Choir, Shardborn, Spiritwalkers, Ruby Council
- **Player Hooks:** Stop or aid the awakening, protect or sabotage the Ruby Council, battle an undead king.

## **Religion**

### **Path of the First Light**

#### Cities:
- **Vaer Rhadin**: Grand solar altars crown the highest towers. Festivals revolve around dawn and the zenith of the sun.
- **Sunken Palace**: Secret cults revere the Last Ashen King as a \"Child of the First Sun.\"

#### Factions:
- **Silent Choir**: Twisted version — believing the Ashen Kings are the true heirs of the First Light.
- **Gilded Scarabs**: Many Scarab relic-hunters secretly pursue shards as sacred artifacts, not just for profit.

#### Everyday Culture:
- Wedding vows are often sealed at first light.
- Relic markets in desert cities include "blessed" sun-fragments.

## **Artifacts**

### **The Dawnshard Crown**

**Origin:**
Forged from a pure fragment of the First Sun before it shattered.

**Powers:**
- Grants radiant command — ability to blind, heal, or sear entire battlefields with solar flares.

**Downside:**
- Wearing it slowly burns away the wearer’s memories until only ambition remains.

**Adventure Hook:**
- The Ruby Council of Vaer Rhadin seeks the missing crown to legitimize a "true king" — but so does the Silent Choir for darker purposes.

**Visual Description:**
- A crown of seven fragmented gold-and-crystal shards that hover slightly above the wearer’s head, connected by radiant light instead of physical metal.

**Fake Legends and Rumors:**
- "The Dawnshard Crown ain't no relic — it's cursed! Every king who wore it burned alive from the inside."
- "They say it was never a crown — it was the shattered soul of the First Sun itself, desperate to be made whole."
- "A Sunseeker priest once found it, they say — but he crowned himself a god and vanished into the desert."

**Adventure Seed:**
A desperate merchant-prince of Vaer Rhadin hires the players to find a \"false crown\" to fool the people during his coronation — but other factions seek the *real* Dawnshard Crown and will stop at nothing.
